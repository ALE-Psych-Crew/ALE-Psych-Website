## Welcome

The ALE Psych wiki collects notes, guides, and reference material to help you set up the engine, learn the scripting APIs, and share your own mods.

- Browse the sections on the right to jump into setup or modding specifics.
- Each page ends with a quick metadata block and a link back to the repository for edits.
- Comments are powered by giscus so you can leave questions or clarifications directly on the article.

### What to expect

Expect concise steps, copy-paste snippets, and links to the official Lua API. If you are new, start with **Getting Started**, then move into **Installation** to grab the latest build. When you are ready to tinker, hop into the **Modding** section.
