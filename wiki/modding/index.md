## Folder layout

Organize mods into their own directories. Keep sprites, charts, and scripts grouped to avoid conflicts.

### Quick links

- Character tips live in the **Characters** page.
- Song metadata and charting notes live in **Songs**.

Maintaining a clean hierarchy will make updates safer and reduce load times.
