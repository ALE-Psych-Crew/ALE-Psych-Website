## Chart notes

Keep BPM consistent across difficulties and avoid silent lead-ins longer than necessary.

### Metadata snippet

```json
{
  "song": "fresh",
  "needsVoices": true,
  "player1": "bf",
  "opponent": "dad"
}
```

If your charts desync, double-check the time signature and audio trimming.
